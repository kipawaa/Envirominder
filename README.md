# Envirominder
Every morning when you first open chrome, this extension will give you a tip on how to be more environmentally conscious, or a little challenge on how to be more environmentally friendly today. To avoid being a nuissance, this will only happen the first time you open your browser each day.

# TODO
- move list of tips to external file and read from that
- make sure popup appears on first browser launch
- add more tips
